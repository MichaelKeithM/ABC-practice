# ABC Practice
Alphabet practice for my wife's international KG class.

She teaches 4-5 year old boys in a middle east classroom. The students are native Arabic speakers. This course
is really teaching English as a Foreign Language.

This app is used on a computer connected to an overhead projector. When the cursor is hovered over a letter,
it's opacity changes to 100% and the border/letter are highlighted. The students are to identify the highlighted
letter.
